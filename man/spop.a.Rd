\description{
State population, annual, 1900 through 2016, from the Census Bureau. One row per state per year.
\cr\cr
Wherever possible, I have used Census Bureau intercensal estimates,
including for the decennial census years. The exceptions are 1970 and 1980, where I have not found the intercensal
estimates and so have used decennial population. The intercensal estimates are as of July 1 whereas the decennial
estimates are as of April 1. Thus, the change from 1969 to 1970 is from July to April (9 months) and the change
from 1970 to 1971 is from April to July (15 months).
\cr\cr
Includes all 50 states, United States (US) totals, and District of Columbia (DC) for all years (no values for AK
or HI before statehood). Includes Puerto Rico (PR) for 2000 and later. Does not include Virgin Islands or American Samoa.
All numbers are as reported by the Census Bureau - no calculated values.
