\description{
State population, quarterly, 1900 through latest available annual year, plus 1 year. One row per state per quarter.
\cr\cr
Forecasted and interpolated, based on the latest actual annual data (spop.a). The purpose of this is to have quarterly data
that are plausible, for purposes of computing various measures that may be of interest (e.g., taxes per capita on a quarterly basis).
\cr\cr
Includes same states and years as annual data, EXCEPT for Puerto Rico, where there are not enough data for
forecasting and interpolation.
\cr\cr
Annual data are forecast 2 years ahead via exponential smothing with multiplicative errors and a multiplicative trend.
The data are then interpolated to quarterly using a spline function.
